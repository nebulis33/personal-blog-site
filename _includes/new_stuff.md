## Our Difference
Have you ever hired someone and
not heard from them for weeks or longer?  Have you hired
a dev and they delivered you a final product with no input
leaving you with the choice of accepting it or paying more
for something new? Bad experiences like this can ruin
your perception and make you hesitant to try anything new.
Luckily, we understand how you feel and we continually
strive to make sure your experience with us is positive.
